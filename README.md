# dotfiles

1ambd4â€™s dotfiles

Use [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) to manage my dotfiles, which use `~/.dotfiles` `~/.rcrc` .

```bash
lsrc						# list dotfiles managed by rcm
mkrc						# bless files into a dotfile managed by rcm
rcup						# update and install dotfiles managed by rcm
rcdn						# remove dotfiles as managed by rcm
```
